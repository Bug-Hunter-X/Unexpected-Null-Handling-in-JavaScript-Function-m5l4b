# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in a simple JavaScript function involving null value handling. The function `foo` adds two numbers but attempts to gracefully handle null inputs. However, there might be edge cases or unexpected behavior not explicitly addressed.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function correctly returns `null` if either `a` or `b` is null.  However, the function's behavior might not be sufficiently robust for all possible input types or unexpected null values embedded within other data structures (e.g., objects, arrays). A more comprehensive solution should consider these edge cases for better resilience.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates improvements in handling null or undefined values more robustly, including checks for other data types and potential type coercion issues.
